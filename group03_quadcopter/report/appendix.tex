\section{Appendix: matlab code}
The following matlab files are important to run the code:
\begin{itemize}
	\item part4\_1\_lin\_approx.m
	\item part4\_2\_discrete\_matrix.m
	\item part4\_3.m
\end{itemize}

"part4\_1\_lin\_approx.m" contains code to set up the linear model. "part4\_2\_discrete\_matrix.m" contains the numerical analysis of the the discrete model. "part4\_3.m" contains the calculation of the matrices for 4 things:

\begin{itemize}
	\item the full state controller
	\item LQR with integral action
	\item full state controller with weight of 0.1
	\item The kallman filter
\end{itemize}

After the user executed a perticular section "part4\_3.m"  and so calculated the matrices its possible to run the following simulink files that use them:

\begin{itemize}
	\item part4\_3\_fullstate.slx
	\item part4\_3\_integrator.slx
	\item part4\_4\_simu\_LQG\_.slx
	\item part4\_4\_simu\_LQG\_kalmanF.slx
\end{itemize}
