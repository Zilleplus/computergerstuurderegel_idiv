\section{LQR controller without payload}
\subsection{full-state feedback controller}
\subsubsection{Introduction}
The system with the full state controller is given by $u_k=N_ur_k - K(\hat{x}_k-N_xr_k)$.With $\bar{N} = N_u + KN_x$ $N_u$ and $N_x$ are determined by equation~\ref{eq:full state Nx Nu formula}. If this control law is filled in in $x_{k+1} = Ax_k + bu_k$ the the augmented system is defined by: $x_{k+1}=(A-BK)x_k + B(N_u - KN_x)r_k$. This system does not have any inputs so its not controllable. If C is taken as a diagonal matrix then it is observable.

\begin{equation}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		A-I & B \\
		C & D
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		N_x\\
		N_u
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		0 \\
		I
	\end{bmatrix}
	\label{eq:full state Nx Nu formula}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Simulink simulation}
The controller is constructed in Simulink (Figure~\ref{fig:diagram full-state feedback controller}) according to the diagram on page 221 of the course notes. A type 1 full-state feedback was used as its more robust, which is desirable as its controlling a flying object with even a weight on it later on.

The matrix K is calculate with the LQR method as was done in the second exercise session. However in order to use LQR the matrices Q and R are needed. As LQR minimizes $J_N = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1}[x_k^TQx_k + u^T_kRu_k] + \frac{1}{2}x_N^TQx_N$. Notice how Q determines the weights given to $x_k$ and and R determines the weights given to $u_k$. 

If Q and R are taken as an diagonal matrix with ones on the diagonal then the quad copter does not have enough power to stay in the air. This is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:full-state controller with simple diagonal matrices as Q and R}.  Figure~\ref{fig:full-state controller with simple diagonal matrices as Q and R demo bad z position} indicates clearly that the controller does not optimize enough on the z axis.

\end{figure}

In order to get a balanced controller more weight must be given to optimizing on the position z. This is realized by increasing the corresponding value in Q, as the z coordinate is an state.

$$ 
Q=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & ... \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & ...\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & ... \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & ... \\
... & ... & ... & ... & ... 
\end{bmatrix}
=>
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & ... \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & ...\\
0 & 0 & 10^2 & 0 & ... \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & ... \\
... & ... & ... & ... & ... 
\end{bmatrix}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:full-state controller with adjusted Q matrix but a unit matrix as R} contains the results of the full state controller with the adjusted Q matrix. The quad-copter does reach all its checkpoint but the input voltages on the motors are rather low. 

Lowering the values of R  will result in higher voltages and so an increase speed. But keeping robustness in mind R must still be sufficiently large to avoid an oscillating or extremely fast changing output. A diagonal value of 0.1 seems to be reasonable for R, this is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:full-state controller with proper diagonal matrices as Q and R}.

The adjustment of R improves the average time from 3.736 to 3.214 s. Notice how the voltage also get lower in Figure~\ref{fig:full-state controller with proper diagonal matrices as Q and R - voltages}, the controller is a bit more nervous then in Figure~\ref{fig:full-state controller with low voltage}.
