\subsection{Comparison results}
The integrator is quiet fast with its 2.964 seconds run time compared to the 3.214 seconds run time of the full-state feedback controller. However the matrices Q and R where way harder to determine for the integrator then the full-state feedback controller. Even tough the integrator only hard 3 extra states, those states made it significantly harder to determine Q and R.
