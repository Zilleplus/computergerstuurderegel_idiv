\subsection{full-state feedback controller}

The controller is constructed in Simulink (Figure~\ref{fig:simulink diagram full-state feedback controller}) according to the diagram on page 221 of the course notes.

The matrix K is calculate with the LQR method as we did in the second exercise session. However in order to do LQR we need a matrix Q and R. As LQR minimizes $J_N = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1}[x_k^TQx_k + u^T_kRu_k] + \frac{1}{2}x_N^TQx_N$. Notice how Q determines the weights given to $x_k$ and and R determines the weights given to $u_k$. 

If Q and R are taken as an diagonal matrix with ones on the diagonal then the quad copter does not have enough power to stay in the air. This is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:full-state controller with simple diagonal matrices as Q and R}. Its very clear from Figure~\ref{fig:full-state controller with simple diagonal matrices as Q and R demo bad z position} that the controller does not optimize enough on the z axis.

In order to get a proper controller we need to put way more weight on the position z in the optimization problem. This is done by increasing a value in Q, as the z coordinate is an state. 

$$ 
Q=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & ... \\
0 & 1 & 0 & ...\\
0 & 0 & 1 & ... \\
... & ... & ... & ... 
\end{bmatrix}
=>
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & ...\\
0 & 1 & 0 & ...\\
0 & 0 & 10^{7} & ... \\
... & ... & ... & ... 
\end{bmatrix}
$$
