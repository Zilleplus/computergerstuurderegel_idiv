\section{Introduction}
The report tries to follow the order of the assignment as much as possible. For each part there is Matlab code, the appendix briefly explains which files belong to which part of the report. Some of the figures are added as an appendix. The text specifically refers to them when the reader should take a look at them, they are of little value on there own.
